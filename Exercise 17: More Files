# The Code Part: // wirte a Python script to copy one files to another
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists # exists() means to turn True if a file
                           # exists, based on its name in a string as an argument
                           # It returns Flase if not.

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)

#we could do these two on one line, how?
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)

print "Does the ouput file exist? %r" % exists(to_file)
print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort."
raw_input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w') # "w", it is just a string with a character in it for
# the kind of mode for the file. If you use "w" then you are saying "open this file"
# in 'write' mode, thus the 'w' character. There is also 'r' for "read", 'a' for append
# and modifiers on these.

out_file.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."

out_file.close()
in_file.close()


# The Outcome Part:
$ cat test.txt
This is a test file.
$
$ python ex17.py test.txt new_file.txt
Copying from test.txt to new_file.txt
The input file is 21 bytes long
Does the output file exist? False
Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort.

Alright, all done.
